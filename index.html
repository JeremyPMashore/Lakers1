    <p class = "text1"> This is one of the best highlights from Kobe Bryant. It was one of his biggest comeback games of all time.
        It was the Lakers Vs the Raptors in 2013, and the fans roared as Kobe almost single to none came back so hard! This is one
        of the highest peaks in Kobe Bryant's carrer, and really paved the way for his dominace in the LA Lakers. Basketball is a true
        genetic, and skill sport. This clip just shows Kobes legacy will not be forgotten any time soon!! Kobe Bryant is one of the best NBA
        players to exist, and will be in the hall of fame forever!  </p>

    <h1 class = "heading2">A Game That Made "Black Mamba"!</h1>
    <p class = "text2">This is another one of Kobe's best highlights in his carrer. It was the Lakers Vs the Rockets in 2009.
       Kobe had so many huge plays in this game from aly opps to steals. This was another game where he went from lossing
       to gaining a 40 point comeback. Most people weren't huge "Black Mamba" fans before this game, but hopped in as his carrer
       kept skyrocketing! Kobe was nearly a rookie back in 1997. So seeing him play like an all star only roughly 11 years into his
       carrer is mind numbing. This game is what really pushed the lakers to pure fame! </p>

<h1 class = "heading3">Kobe's Bryant's Carrer</h1>
<p class = "text3">Kobe Bryant joined the Lakers in 1996 when he was 20th in the draft pick. He has only been on the LA Lakers
   team, and has never switched during his entire carrer. He was a complete rookie in 1996, but quickly gained traction starting on January 2nd, 2006.
   This game kobe scored 81 points against the Raptors. This came down as one of the best single performance in all of NBA history!! He has since then gained
   NBA Hall of fame, and had many performances just like the Raptors game. Like the game shown in 2013 against the Raptors again. As well as the game Vs the Rockets
   in 2009. His carrer only went up from there as he kept gaining more, and more traction. Until sadly in 2020 he, and his daughter tragically crashed in a helicopter as
he was making his way to the airport. This left many fans sad as fans should be. His memory will always be remmembered as one of the best Nba players of all time.

<h1 class = "heading4">All of Kobe's Main Mentors!</h1>
<p class = "text4">Kobe had tons of mentors throught his basketball carrer. One of the main idols he lokked up to
   was non other than Micheal Jackson. He saw how he went from nothing to one of the biggest music artist of all time, and
   used it to fuel his passion. He had basketball mentors like the best basketball player of all time micheal Jordan. He also had others like Phil
   Jackson be by his side, and Jerry West! As Kobe started as a rookie he had help, and made the most unlikely of friendships starting off. This helped pave
   his carrer to be one of the best of the best we have ever seen! Some would even compare Kobe Bryants skill to that of the best of all time Micheal Jordan.
   Which isn't suprising at all as one of his main mentors was the best of all time himself! Kobe bryant is a true showcase of hardwork, and passion
   Showing the world that if you work hard enough you can accomplish anything in life if you really put your mind to it!

<div class = "summary">
<h1 class = "end">Summary</h1>
<p class = "text5">To summarize Kobe Bryant is one of the best basketball players of all time. There is no question that he will be remmembered for the rest of basketball
    history. He played hard, and showed true love for the NBA. Not only did he plove you can be any man starting off from anywhere, and be successfull. He also showed that
    you can't do it alone. Everyone needs their fair share of support when it comes to tackling large hurdles in their carrers. With this Kobe Bryant was no exeption. He proved
    not just Micheal Jordan could play the best, but anyone can if they work hard enough to improve their overall skill, and mindsets. With this Kobe Bryant will be remmembered way after death,
    and be known as one if not second to best players in NBA history in the hall of fame!! If you want to share on Twitter what you learned or share this article with others click
